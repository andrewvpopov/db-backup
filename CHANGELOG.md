# Changelog

All notable changes to `@andrewvpopov/db-backup`. Versions are git tags
(`vX.Y.Z`); see STANDARDS.md.

## 0.4.0

Operational retention/cleanup surface (requested by sano-os). Additive — all
existing `backup`/`restore`/`list` behavior and defaults are unchanged.

- **Configurable retention** from the CLI/env instead of a hard-coded policy:
  `--max-backups <n>` / `--daily-slots <n>`, or `DB_BACKUP_MAX_BACKUPS` /
  `DB_BACKUP_DAILY_SLOTS`. Precedence: flag > env > default. The age-tier
  anchors stay policy-owned. New export `resolveRetentionPolicy()`.
- **`prune` command**: apply the retention policy to an existing backup
  directory without creating a new snapshot — a standalone cleanup pass. New
  export `pruneBackupsJob()`.
- **Fix**: `list` (and the new `prune`) no longer require `DATABASE_URL`. They
  operate purely on the backup directory and never open the database;
  previously `list` failed with `DATABASE_URL is missing`. Programmatic callers
  can pass `requireDatabaseUrl: false` on any `BackupOptions`.
- **`cron` emits a usable entry**: it now reflects `--output-dir`, `--prod`, and
  `--allow-missing` into a `npx db-backup backup ...` command (resolves the
  local bin under npm and pnpm) and defaults the log path to
  `<output-dir>/backup.log`. Override the whole command with `--command` and the
  log with `--log-path`. Previously it hard-coded `npm run db:backup -- --prod`.
- Hardening: retention counts are strictly validated (fractional/suffixed values
  like `1.5`/`3x` are rejected, not silently truncated), and `buildDailyCronEntry`
  single-quote-escapes its payload so a quote in a command/path can't malform the
  emitted cron line.

## 0.3.1

- Fix ESM named imports of the storage helpers: export them as shorthand
  identifiers so Node's cjs-module-lexer detects them. `key: storage.fn` was
  invisible to `import { fn } from "@andrewvpopov/db-backup"` (hit by stoki/sano,
  which run ESM). No API change.
- verify-pack now also runs an ESM `import { ... }` smoke to catch this class.

## 0.3.0

Generalizes stoki/pantry's admin backup-storage subsystem into shared,
policy-free helpers (BWK-85), so any consumer gets multi-directory backups,
restore path-safety, and manifest tracking. Purely additive — existing
`runBackupJob`/`restoreBackup`/`listBackupsWithPlan` behavior is unchanged.

New exports (`src/storage.js`):
- `resolveBackupDirectories({ env, envVar, candidates, home })` — merge a CSV
  env var (default `BACKUP_DIRS`) with a caller-supplied candidate list, expand
  `~/`, de-dup. The caller owns the directory policy.
- `getBackupFallbackDirectory({ cwd })` — default write target.
- `resolveContainedBackupPath(candidate, { directories, home })` — resolve a
  user-supplied restore path and confirm it's contained within an allowed
  directory; returns `null` on traversal/arbitrary-file access. Callers MUST
  gate restore on this.
- `readBackupManifest(dir)` / `appendBackupManifestEntry(dir, entry)` — a
  per-directory `backup-manifest.json` tracking labels + source.
- `isContainedWithin`, `expandHome`, `MANIFEST_FILENAME` helpers.

## 0.2.0

Ports the genuinely-better features from sano-os `@sano/sqlite-backup` into the
consolidated package (BWK-85), so the whole estate shares them.

- **SQLite integrity verification**: after `.backup`, run `PRAGMA
  integrity_check` on the snapshot (when sqlite3 is available) and delete +
  throw if it isn't `ok` — a corrupt backup is worse than a loud failure.
- **`--allow-missing`**: a scheduled/deploy backup no-ops instead of failing
  when the SQLite database file doesn't exist yet (fresh installs).

## 0.1.0

Initial extraction from bewks `packages/db-backup-manager` (BWK-85), the base
for consolidating the two backup packages across the estate (bewks +
sano-os `@sano/sqlite-backup`).

- Age-tier retention policy (`DEFAULT_RETENTION_POLICY`, `planRetention`).
- SQLite online backup via `sqlite3 .backup`, optional gzip compression.
- Postgres backup via `pg_dump --format=custom`.
- Restore (SQLite + Postgres) with optional pre-restore backup.
- `runBackupJob`, `listBackupsWithPlan`, `restoreBackup`, `buildDailyCronEntry`,
  `runCli` CLI, and injectable `runtime` seams for testing.
- Ships the shared-package release loop (CI, `verify:pack`, STANDARDS) from the
  prisma-tools pilot.

Deferred to 0.2.0: port sano's `PRAGMA integrity_check` verification,
`--allow-missing` flag, and backup-prefix validation, then adopt in sano-os.
