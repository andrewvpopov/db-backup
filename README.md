# @andrewpopov/db-backup

Backs up SQLite and PostgreSQL databases from a CLI or a Node API: timestamped
compressed dumps, retention policies, optional GPG encryption at rest, verified
off-host replication via rclone **or native S3/R2** (no rclone binary
required), and a freshness check that catches a cron job which has silently
stopped producing backups. Built for self-hosted apps where the backup job has
to be trustworthy without a human watching it.

## Install

```bash
npm install github:andrewpopov/db-backup#v0.17.2
```

## Retention

Four retention strategies. **Age-tier** is the default; **keep-last** and
**keep-days** are flat alternatives; **GFS** (grandfather-father-son) is a
fully configurable declarative policy applied identically to every
destination. The modes are mutually exclusive — pick one; combining flags
from two modes is an error, not a silent pick.

### GFS (grandfather-father-son) — the recommended way to configure retention

```bash
db-backup backup --retain-daily 7 --retain-weekly 4 --retain-monthly 12 --retain-yearly 2
```

means: keep the **7 most-recent** backups as daily slots, then **one backup
per week** for 4 weeks, **one backup per month** for 12 months, and **one
backup per year** for 2 years. A backup is kept if it is the newest backup in
*any* bucket it qualifies for; everything else is pruned. A backup that is
simultaneously the newest of its week *and* its month is kept once, not
double-counted.

Programmatically, the same policy object works everywhere `policy` is
accepted:

```js
const policy = { mode: 'gfs', daily: 7, weekly: 4, monthly: 12, yearly: 2 };
await runBackupJobAsync({ destinations: [...], policy });
```

**Worked example.** Given nightly backups going back 14 months, this policy
keeps: the 7 most-recent nights; the single newest backup from each of the 4
weeks before that; the single newest backup from each of the 12 (30-day)
months before that; nothing yet from the yearly tier (the oldest backup is
younger than a year). Total kept count is bounded by
`daily + weekly + monthly + yearly` (23 here) but is usually lower, since a
backup already kept by a narrower tier (daily) also satisfies any broader
tier (weekly/monthly/yearly) whose window it falls in — it is never kept
twice.

**Not a parallel retention system.** GFS reuses the exact same "slots +
anchors" engine the age-tier default already used: `daily` is mechanically
identical to `dailySlots` (the N most-recent backups, no age math), and
`weekly`/`monthly`/`yearly` are generated as `RetentionAnchor`s — one per
bucket, each targeting the newest backup within it. For anything the
generated buckets can't express, supply your own `anchors` — either
programmatically or via a JSON file:

```bash
db-backup backup --retention-policy ./retention.json
```

```json
{
  "mode": "gfs",
  "daily": 7,
  "anchors": [
    { "key": "black_friday", "label": "Black Friday snapshot", "minAgeDays": 300, "maxAgeDays": 400, "targetAgeDays": 330 }
  ]
}
```

`--retention-policy` accepts ANY policy shape (GFS, age-tier, or a flat
mode) — it is the full escape hatch, and cannot be combined with any other
retention flag.

**Sanity-check a policy before trusting it** with `--dry-run`:

```bash
db-backup prune --retain-daily 7 --retain-weekly 4 --dry-run
# [db-backup] DRY RUN — nothing will be deleted.
#   KEEP   | sqlite-backup-20260713-030000Z.db.gz | Daily slot 1 | 2.1 MB
#   KEEP   | sqlite-backup-20260706-030000Z.db.gz | Weekly slot 2 | 2.0 MB
#   DELETE | sqlite-backup-20260705-030000Z.db.gz | Rotate out | 2.0 MB
# [db-backup] Would keep 2 backup(s), would remove 1 backup(s).
```

Nothing is deleted in `--dry-run` mode, and every survivor's line names the
exact reason it was kept.

### Age-tier (legacy default)

Tunable via `--max-backups` / `--daily-slots` or the `DB_BACKUP_MAX_BACKUPS` /
`DB_BACKUP_DAILY_SLOTS` env vars:

- Keep up to **6** backups total (`--max-backups`)
- Keep **3 recent daily** backups (`--daily-slots`)
- Always keep **1 backup from last week**
- Always keep **1 backup from last month**
- Always keep **1 backup from two months ago**

The age-tier anchors (week/month/two-months) are policy-owned; only the total
cap and daily-slot count are exposed on the CLI. **Unchanged** — this remains
the default when no other retention flag is given, exactly as before GFS
existed.

### Flat retention

| Mode | Flag | Env var | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| keep-last | `--keep-last <n>` | `DB_BACKUP_KEEP_LAST` | Keep the **N most-recent** backups; rotate out the rest. `n >= 1`. |
| keep-days | `--keep-days <n>` | `DB_BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS` | Keep every backup **strictly younger than N days**. `n >= 1`. |

```bash
db-backup backup --prod --keep-last 8      # e.g. 8 weekly backups
db-backup prune  --keep-days 30            # e.g. a 30-day window
```

Notes (apply to every mode, including GFS):

- **`keep-days` always retains the single most-recent backup**, even when it is
  older than the window. A long gap between runs can never delete every backup.
- `keep-last` requires `n >= 1`, so a flat count can never mean "delete
  everything".
- A backup dated in the future (clock skew) is clamped to *now* for both
  ordering and age, so it is treated as brand new rather than as negative-age.
- **Precedence:** an explicit CLI argument always beats an env var. Combining
  options from two different retention modes (e.g. `--retain-daily` with
  `--keep-last`, or `--max-backups` with `--keep-days`) is an error, not a
  silent pick. An env var selects a flat mode only when no retention option
  was passed explicitly, so a stale `DB_BACKUP_KEEP_LAST` cannot silently
  override an explicit `--max-backups`.
- **The newest backup is NEVER pruned**, whatever the policy computes — a
  hard safety guard inside `planRetention` itself, so it applies to every
  caller (backup, prune, list) and every destination (local, rclone, S3)
  uniformly. A policy whose own selection would keep *nothing* (while
  backups exist) THROWS rather than silently emptying the backup directory.

## Destinations: WHERE backups go

`destinations` (and its CLI form, repeatable `--dest`) is an explicit list of
where a backup is replicated to — orthogonal to `policy` (**which**/how many
survive). This is the new, recommended way to configure location; the legacy
`--output-dir`/`--remote`/`--s3-bucket`/`--skip-remote` flags keep working
exactly as before (see below) and cannot be mixed with `--dest`.

```bash
db-backup backup \
  --dest local:/srv/app/backups \
  --dest s3:andrewpopov-db-backups/daily/app \
  --retain-daily 7 --retain-weekly 4 --retain-monthly 12 --retain-yearly 2
```

```js
await runBackupJobAsync({
  destinations: [
    { type: 'local', path: '/srv/app/backups' },
    { type: 's3', bucket: 'andrewpopov-db-backups', prefix: 'daily/app' },
    // { type: 'rclone', target: 'r2:backups/app' },
  ],
  policy: { mode: 'gfs', daily: 7, weekly: 4, monthly: 12, yearly: 2 },
});
```

- **`local` is not a privileged default.** A caller may configure `s3`-only
  (or `rclone`-only) — the backup is staged on disk, uploaded, verified, and
  then the local staging copy is removed, exactly like today's `skipRemote`
  never leaving a phantom local file, but without requiring a local
  destination to exist at all.
- **Zero destinations aborts** — "you must choose where backups go" — the
  same fail-closed spirit as the local-only guard below, generalized to any
  number of destinations.
- **One retention plan drives every destination.** Once a GFS policy
  (`--retain-*`/`--retention-policy`/a `policy` with `mode: 'gfs'`) is
  configured, `planRetention` runs against each destination's own listing and
  produces the exact same keep/remove decision everywhere — local and S3 (or
  rclone) can no longer drift apart. Without a GFS policy, each remote
  destination keeps its own legacy flat count (`--remote-keep`, default 30),
  exactly as before this release.
- **Legacy flags map onto the same `destinations` shape internally** — there
  is one retention/distribution engine underneath both models, not two.
  `--remote <target>` and `--s3-bucket <name>` continue to work exactly as
  documented in [Off-host replication](#off-host-replication) below; mixing
  them with `--dest` is an error.

## `db-backup.config.json`

An app with a fixed backup setup can declare it once instead of re-typing the
same ~10 flags in a deploy script:

```json
{
  "databaseUrl": "file:/srv/cairn/packages/api/prisma/cairn.db",
  "destinations": [
    { "type": "local", "path": "/srv/cairn-backups" },
    { "type": "s3", "bucket": "andrewpopov-db-backups", "prefix": "daily/cairn" }
  ],
  "retention": { "daily": 7, "weekly": 4, "monthly": 12, "yearly": 2 },
  "encryptPassphraseFile": "/var/lib/cairn/secrets/backup.pass",
  "minBytes": 1048576,
  "commandTimeoutSeconds": 900,
  "stampFile": "/srv/cairn-backups/.last-success",
  "stopWritersCmd": "pm2 stop cairn-app",
  "startWritersCmd": "pm2 start cairn-app"
}
```

```bash
db-backup backup --config db-backup.config.json
# or, with a file named exactly db-backup.config.json in the cwd:
db-backup backup
```

Resolution order: explicit `--config <path>` > `db-backup.config.json` in the
current directory > none. **CLI flags always override a config value; a
config value always overrides the built-in default.**

- **Never put credentials in this file.** A config that sets
  `accessKeyId`/`secretAccessKey`/`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  (at the top level or on a destination) is REJECTED outright — S3
  credentials remain environment-only.
- **An unreadable `encryptPassphraseFile` aborts before any backup work**,
  whether it came from the config or `--encrypt-passphrase-file` — this used
  to only surface after a wasted snapshot, at gpg-invocation time.
- **Zero destinations aborts**, same as the `destinations` option above.
- Mixing a config's `destinations`/`retention` with the legacy location/
  retention flags is an error, same rule as mixing `--dest`/`--retain-*` with
  the legacy flags.

## Encryption at rest

```bash
db-backup backup --prod --encrypt-passphrase-file /var/lib/app/secrets/backup.pass
```

Runs `gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256` and writes `<name>.db.gz.gpg`, removing
the plaintext. The passphrase is read from a **file**, never passed as an argument
(arguments are visible in the process table). If `gpg` is unavailable the backup
**fails** rather than silently writing plaintext. `restore` decrypts transparently
and refuses without the passphrase.

## Filename prefix

```bash
db-backup backup --prod --name-prefix myapp     # myapp-<ts>.db.gz.gpg
```

Defaults to `sqlite-backup` / `postgres-backup`. Set it to adopt an existing
backup history written under another name. The engine is read from the extension
(`.db` / `.dump`), not the prefix.

`list`, `prune` and `restore` are **scoped to the prefix**, so one app's job can
never prune another app's backups in a shared directory or remote bucket. With no
prefix set, only the canonical names are recognised — the default is not widened.

## Off-host replication

A backup on the same disk as the database is not a backup — one disk failure
loses both. **`backup` refuses to run unless this is a deliberate choice:** it
aborts if none of `--remote` (rclone), `--s3-bucket` (native S3/R2, see
below), or `--skip-remote` (an explicit opt-out) is given. There is no silent
local-only default.

```bash
db-backup backup --prod \
  --encrypt-passphrase-file /var/lib/app/secrets/backup.pass \
  --remote offsite:backups/app --remote-keep 30 \
  --stamp-file /var/lib/app/backups/.last-success
```

Uploads with `rclone copyto`, then **re-reads the object** and compares its byte
count to the local artifact. **Nothing is pruned and no success is stamped until
that verification passes** — a failed or unverified upload leaves the previous
backups and the previous stamp untouched. An unparseable `rclone` response is a
failure, not a pass. If `rclone` is missing, the run refuses rather than silently
skipping the off-site copy.

Remote retention never deletes the object it just uploaded (a host whose clock
rolled backward would otherwise delete the only verified copy).

If you genuinely want a local-only run — a pre-migration deploy hook, local
dev, a first bootstrap run before offsite is wired up — pass `--skip-remote`
(`skipRemote: true`) to say so explicitly:

```bash
db-backup backup --skip-remote   # local-only, on purpose
```

`BackupJobResult.localOnly` is `true` for such a run, and both the CLI and a
`console.warn` surface a visible warning so it's never mistaken for a
replicated backup. Omitting **both** `--remote` and `--skip-remote` is the one
thing that's no longer allowed — that combination now throws:

```
Refusing to create a local-only backup: no --remote/--s3-bucket is configured
and --skip-remote was not passed. A backup on the same disk as the database
is not a backup — a single disk failure destroys both. Configure --remote
<dest> (offsite replication via rclone) or --s3-bucket <bucket> (native AWS
S3 / Cloudflare R2), or pass --skip-remote (skipRemote: true) to explicitly
accept the same-disk risk.
```

### Cloudflare R2 (and other S3-compatible targets)

The `--remote` target is just an [rclone](https://rclone.org) remote, so any
backend rclone supports works — Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, Backblaze B2, or a second
local disk. To replicate to R2, define an rclone remote once:

```bash
rclone config create r2 s3 \
  provider=Cloudflare \
  access_key_id=<R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID> \
  secret_access_key=<R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> \
  endpoint=https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com \
  region=auto acl=private no_check_bucket=true
```

The access key ID and secret come from the R2 dashboard (**Manage R2 API Tokens**
→ an *S3 credential* pair — not a general Cloudflare API token, which cannot sign
S3 requests). Then point `--remote` at a bucket and prefix:

```bash
db-backup backup --prod \
  --remote r2:my-bucket/my-app --remote-keep 30 \
  --rclone-config ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
```

The upload, byte-verification, and remote retention described above apply
unchanged — the remote is opaque to `db-backup`.

### Native S3 remote (no rclone) — AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2

If you'd rather not install and configure `rclone` at all, `--s3-bucket`
uploads directly to S3 or R2 using AWS Signature V4, implemented with
`node:crypto` and the global `fetch` — **zero new runtime dependencies**, and
this is a **second, independent remote type**: `--remote` (rclone) and
`--s3-bucket` are mutually exclusive (configuring both is an error), but
`--remote` continues to work exactly as before if you're already using it.

**Credentials are read from the environment only — never a CLI flag**, which
would leak into `ps` output and shell history:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
# or, if you prefer S3_*-named vars: S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID / S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

**AWS S3** (no `--s3-endpoint`; region defaults to `us-east-1`):

```bash
db-backup backup --prod \
  --s3-bucket my-bucket --s3-prefix my-app --s3-region us-east-1 \
  --remote-keep 30 \
  --stamp-file /var/lib/app/backups/.last-success
```

**Cloudflare R2** (set `--s3-endpoint` to your account's R2 endpoint; region
defaults to `auto`, R2's own convention, when an endpoint is set). Credentials
here are R2's S3 API token pair (**Manage R2 API Tokens** → an *S3
credential*, not a general Cloudflare API token):

```bash
db-backup backup --prod \
  --s3-bucket my-bucket --s3-prefix my-app \
  --s3-endpoint https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com \
  --remote-keep 30 \
  --stamp-file /var/lib/app/backups/.last-success
```

Same fail-closed contract as the rclone remote: the backup is `PUT`, then
**re-read with a `HEAD`** and its size (and, for the single-part upload this
package always does, its ETag against the file's MD5) compared to the local
artifact. **Nothing is pruned and no success is stamped until that
verification passes.** Missing credentials, a non-2xx response, or a
verification mismatch all throw — the error never contains the access key or
secret key.

**Design notes:**
- **Signing:** the payload hash is a real SHA-256 of the file body (not
  `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD`) — the file is already being read into memory for the
  upload, so a real hash costs nothing extra and lets S3 itself catch
  transport corruption.
- **Upload is a buffered single-part PUT** — the whole file is read into
  memory and sent in one request. Fine for SQLite/`pg_dump`-sized backups;
  **S3 caps a single-part PUT at 5 GiB**, and a backup above that size fails
  with a clear error *before* any upload is attempted, rather than being
  silently truncated. Multipart upload is not implemented.
- **Transport:** the S3 remote uses the real, `await`ed `fetch` — no worker
  thread, no event-loop block. That is why S3 has its own async job function,
  `runBackupJobAsync` (see [Programmatic API](#programmatic-api) below);
  `runBackupJob` (the synchronous API) throws if `s3` is configured rather
  than either blocking the caller's event loop or silently doing nothing.
  Every request is bounded by `--s3-timeout <seconds>` (env
  `DB_BACKUP_S3_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 300s).
- **Remote retention:** `--remote-keep <n>` (default 30) works the same way
  it does for rclone — the bucket/prefix is listed and the oldest objects
  beyond `n` are deleted, never including the object just uploaded and
  verified. **Only applies when no GFS policy is configured** — once
  `--retain-*`/`--retention-policy` (or a `policy` with `mode: 'gfs'`) is set,
  S3 (like rclone) follows that SAME unified plan instead; see
  [Destinations: WHERE backups go](#destinations-where-backups-go).

## Backup liveness

A cron backup that silently stops producing files is invisible. `--stamp-file` is
written **only** after a fully successful run:

```bash
db-backup backup --prod --stamp-file /var/lib/app/backups/.last-success
db-backup freshness --stamp-file /var/lib/app/backups/.last-success --max-age-hours 36
```

`freshness` exits non-zero when the last success is too old **or when no backup was
ever recorded**. Pair it with `--min-bytes` so a truncated database — which passes
`PRAGMA integrity_check` — fails loudly instead of rotating out a good backup.

### Backup lifecycle states and markers

Every `BackupEntry` (from `listBackupsWithPlan`, `listBackups`, etc.) carries a `state`:

| state | meaning |
|---|---|
| `completed` | Backed by a real, verified artifact on disk — every entry that existed before this field was added. |
| `running` | A job is currently working on this backup. Represented by a `<fileName>.inprogress` marker written the instant the job starts, removed the instant it finishes successfully. |
| `failed` | The job that would have produced this backup threw. Represented by a `<fileName>.failed` marker — the `.inprogress` marker renamed in place, holding a small JSON body `{ startedAt, error }` (the error message truncated so a huge stack trace can't bloat the backup directory). |

Markers are not backups: they carry no size requirement and are always excluded from
retention **selection** — `planRetention` never sees them, so a stuck or failed run
can never occupy a keep slot or influence which real backups rotate out. A `.failed`
marker is still swept for cleanup once it's older than the oldest backup the policy is
still keeping (`listBackupsWithPlan`/`pruneBackupsJob` fold it into the removal plan
with `retentionReason: 'stale_marker'`); a `.running` marker is never swept this way — a
stuck job is an operational fact worth keeping visible, not tidying away.

```js
const { listBackupsWithPlan } = require('@andrewpopov/db-backup');

const { backups } = listBackupsWithPlan({ outputDir: '/var/lib/app/backups' });
backups.forEach((b) => console.log(b.fileName, b.state, b.error || ''));
```

### Operational status (admin surfaces)

`getOperationalStatus` combines `checkBackupFreshness` with the newest known entry's
lifecycle state into a single `{ tone, detail, stampedAt? }` — the natural feed for an
admin dashboard's status widget (e.g. admin-kit's `AdminOperationalStatus`):

```js
const { getOperationalStatus } = require('@andrewpopov/db-backup');

const status = getOperationalStatus({
  stampFile: '/var/lib/app/backups/.last-success',
  outputDir: '/var/lib/app/backups',
  maxAgeHours: 36,
});
// { tone: 'healthy' | 'warning' | 'critical', detail: '...', stampedAt?: '...' }
```

Tone precedence, most to least urgent (documented here because it is the one place the
ordering is decided):

1. **The newest entry is a `failed` marker → `critical`.** A failed run beats a fresh
   stamp: the stamp only proves a *past* success, and an operator needs to know the
   *most recent* attempt didn't work even while an older backup is still inside the
   freshness window.
2. **The stamp is dated in the future (clock skew) → `warning`.** The data may well be
   fine; the clock is not, and that's a different problem than a stale backup.
3. **The stamp is stale (not fresh, no clock skew) → `critical`.**
4. **Otherwise → `healthy`.**

### Off-host dead-man's switch (remote freshness + alerts)

A local `--stamp-file` check runs *on the backup host* — so it dies with the host, and
it only exits non-zero; someone still has to watch it. To actually get told when the
backup silently stops, run `freshness --remote` **from a different host** and give it a
notification channel:

```bash
# On a persistent host that is NOT the backup host (a timer, every few hours):
db-backup freshness --remote r2:backups/app --max-age-hours 30 \
  --rclone-config /path/to/rclone.conf \
  --notify-discord https://discord.com/api/webhooks/…
```

`--remote` checks the newest object's age under the rclone remote instead of a local
stamp — verifying the *off-site copy* independently, which catches host death, a broken
timer, a failed upload, and a deleted script alike. On staleness, a missing backup, a
future timestamp (clock skew), or a check that can't run (rclone missing), it alerts:

| flag | delivery |
|---|---|
| `--notify-discord <url>` | POST `{"content": message}` to a Discord webhook |
| `--notify-webhook <url>` | POST `{"text": message}` to any webhook (Slack-style) |
| `--notify-command <cmd>` | run `cmd` with the message in `$DB_BACKUP_ALERT` (generic escape hatch) |

Notifications are **best-effort and synchronous** (POST via `curl`, or run the command) —
a failing webhook never masks or manufactures a verdict, and `freshness` still exits
non-zero on staleness. No new dependency; no `fetch` (so `runCli` stays synchronous and
consumers' `try/catch` is unaffected).

## Supported databases

- SQLite (`DATABASE_URL=file:...`)
- PostgreSQL (`DATABASE_URL=postgres://...` or `postgresql://...`)

## Usage

```bash
# Create backup + apply retention policy
db-backup backup --prod --output-dir /var/backups/myapp

# List backups and retention decisions (dry run — no DB needed)
db-backup list --output-dir /var/backups/myapp

# Apply retention now without taking a new backup (no DB needed)
db-backup prune --output-dir /var/backups/myapp --max-backups 6

# Sanity-check a GFS policy before trusting it — prints the plan, deletes nothing
db-backup prune --output-dir /var/backups/myapp \
  --retain-daily 7 --retain-weekly 4 --retain-monthly 12 --retain-yearly 2 --dry-run

# Declarative: destinations + a GFS policy applied identically everywhere
db-backup backup \
  --dest local:/var/backups/myapp --dest s3:my-bucket/myapp \
  --retain-daily 7 --retain-weekly 4 --retain-monthly 12 --retain-yearly 2

# Or collapse the above into a config file (see `db-backup.config.json` above)
db-backup backup --config db-backup.config.json

# Print a copy-pasteable cron entry for daily execution
db-backup cron --hour 3 --minute 0 --prod --output-dir /var/backups/myapp

# Restore from a specific backup file
db-backup restore --prod --output-dir /var/backups/myapp --file sqlite-backup-20260219-030000Z.db.gz

# Restore from the latest backup in output-dir
db-backup restore --prod --output-dir /var/backups/myapp --latest

# Restore against a LIVE database: quiesce the app around the swap
db-backup restore --prod --output-dir /var/backups/myapp --latest \
  --stop-writers-cmd "pm2 stop myapp" --start-writers-cmd "pm2 start myapp"
```

## Machine-readable output

`db-backup backup --json` (and the programmatic `runBackupJob`/`runBackupJobAsync`
result) always includes a top-level `backupId` field once a backup is created:

```bash
db-backup backup --prod --output-dir /var/backups/myapp --json
```

```json
{
  "created": { "fileName": "sqlite-backup-20260716-030000Z.db.gz", "..." : "..." },
  "backupId": "sqlite-backup-20260716-030000Z.db.gz",
  "...": "..."
}
```

`backupId` is the stable identifier that `restoreBackup`/`db-backup restore --file`
accepts (it is exactly `created.fileName`). Downstream tooling — e.g. a deploy
pipeline correlating a backup hook's output with the artifact it produced — should
read this top-level key rather than reaching into `created.fileName` or
`created.fullPath`, both of which stay in place for back-compat but are not the
contract: a rename of the `created` shape would not be considered a breaking
change to `backupId`.

`backupId` is only present once a backup has actually been created. The CLI's
`--allow-missing` skip path (used when the source database file does not exist
yet, e.g. a fresh install) prints a distinct shape with no `backupId`:

```json
{ "skipped": true, "reason": "SQLite database file not found: ...", "mode": "prod" }
```

## Adoption recipes

### SQLite app

Set `DATABASE_URL` to a Prisma-style SQLite URL and choose a directory that is
outside your source checkout when possible:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=file:./data/app.db
db-backup backup --prod --output-dir /var/backups/myapp
```

When `sqlite3` is available, backups are created with SQLite's online `.backup`
command. If `sqlite3` is not installed, the package falls back to copying the DB
file. SQLite backups are compressed with `gzip` when it is available.

Backup filenames are UTC-timestamped to the second. If another backup already
exists for the same second, the package appends a numeric suffix, such as
`sqlite-backup-20260705-150000Z-2.db.gz`, rather than overwriting the existing
file.

### PostgreSQL app

Set `DATABASE_URL` to a Postgres connection string:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db.example.com:5432/myapp
db-backup backup --prod --output-dir /var/backups/myapp
```

PostgreSQL backups require `pg_dump`. Restores require `pg_restore`.
Same-second PostgreSQL backups use the same numeric suffix pattern, such as
`postgres-backup-20260705-150000Z-2.dump`.

### Daily cron

Generate a copy-pasteable cron entry. `cron` reflects the flags you pass
(`--prod`, `--output-dir`, `--allow-missing`) into the emitted `backup` command
and defaults the log path to `<output-dir>/backup.log`:

```bash
db-backup cron --hour 3 --minute 0 --prod --output-dir /var/backups/myapp --allow-missing
# 0 3 * * * /usr/bin/env bash -lc 'cd "/srv/myapp" && npx db-backup backup --prod --output-dir "/var/backups/myapp" --allow-missing >> "/var/backups/myapp/backup.log" 2>&1'
```

The default command uses `npx db-backup` (resolves the locally-installed bin
under npm and pnpm). Override it entirely with `--command` (e.g. to wrap a
`pnpm exec` or an app npm script) and set the log file with `--log-path`:

```bash
db-backup cron --command 'pnpm exec db-backup backup --allow-missing' --log-path /srv/myapp/logs/backup.log
```

## Environment resolution

The package can read `DATABASE_URL` directly from the process environment, or it
can load env files relative to `cwd`.

- Base file: `.env`
- Dev file: `.env.local`
- Prod file: `.env.production`

Base env is loaded first; mode-specific env is loaded second and overrides base
values. In production mode, `DATABASE_URL` must either be exported in the shell
before the process starts or be present in `.env.production`, unless
`strictProductionEnv: false` is passed programmatically.

## Command timeouts

Every external command (`sqlite3`, `gzip`, `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`) runs with a
process timeout, so a hung binary cannot block a cron run indefinitely. The
default is 10 minutes.

```bash
db-backup backup --prod --command-timeout 120     # seconds
DB_BACKUP_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS=120000 db-backup backup --prod
```

Programmatically, pass `runtime: { commandTimeoutMs }`.

## SQLite engine primitives

`runBackupJob` / `restoreBackup` are the opinionated job API: they resolve env,
choose filenames, write the manifest, and apply retention. When you need your own
destination filename or manifest — an admin "back up now" route, a pre-deploy
hook — use the engine directly instead of shelling out to `sqlite3` yourself:

```js
const {
  createSqliteSnapshot,
  verifySqliteBackupIntegrity,
  restoreSqliteBackup,
  removeSqliteSidecars,
  normalizeRuntime,
} = require('@andrewpopov/db-backup');

const runtime = normalizeRuntime({ commandTimeoutMs: 30_000 });

// WAL-safe, self-contained snapshot at a path you choose. Retries on
// "database is locked", escapes the path, and integrity-checks the result.
createSqliteSnapshot({ sourcePath: '/srv/app/data/app.db', destPath, runtime });

// Atomic restore: temp -> verify -> discard destination sidecars -> rename.
restoreSqliteBackup({ databaseUrl, backupEntry: { fullPath: destPath, compressed: false }, runtime });
```

`verifySqliteBackupIntegrity` is **non-destructive**: it throws on a corrupt file
but never deletes it. Pass `{ deleteOnFailure: true }` only for a file you own —
`createSqliteSnapshot` does this to discard a snapshot it just wrote.

`createSqliteSnapshot` **throws** when `sqlite3` is unavailable, rather than fall
back to a plain byte copy. A copy of a live SQLite database is never guaranteed
consistent: in WAL mode it omits committed transactions still held in the `-wal`,
and in any mode it can tear under a concurrent writer. Checking for a `-wal`
first would not help — a writer can create one between the check and the copy.

Install `sqlite3`, or pass `allowUnsafeCopy` (CLI: `--allow-unsafe-copy`) to
accept an explicitly-inconsistent copy.

## Programmatic API

This package has **two backup-job entry points**, and which one you use
depends on whether you might configure an S3 remote:

- **`runBackupJobAsync(options)`** — the entry point for any in-process/library
  caller: an app server, a Next.js/Express API route, a background worker
  running inside your app. `await` it. It supports `remote` (rclone),
  `s3` (native AWS S3/R2, uploaded over the real async `fetch`), and
  local-only (`skipRemote`) backups.
- **`runBackupJob(options)`** — synchronous, for scripts and tooling that
  genuinely need a synchronous call and never configure an S3 remote. It
  supports `remote` (rclone) and local-only (`skipRemote`) backups exactly as
  before. **It throws if `s3` is configured** — see below.

**Why two.** `fetch` is inherently asynchronous, and Node ships no synchronous
HTTP client. An S3 upload that *looks* synchronous (return a value, no
`await`) can only be built by blocking the underlying thread until the
network call finishes. Blocking the CLI's thread is harmless — it's a
one-shot batch process. Blocking the thread of a library caller **freezes
whatever else that process is doing** for the duration of the upload — for a
Node app server, that means every other request, including health checks,
stalls until the backup finishes uploading. So there is exactly one S3 code
path, it is fully async, and the synchronous API refuses to reach it:

```js
const { runBackupJob } = require('@andrewpopov/db-backup');

runBackupJob({ mode: 'prod', outputDir: '/var/backups/myapp', s3: { bucket: 'my-bucket' } });
// Throws: "runBackupJob (the synchronous API) cannot use an S3 remote: ...
// Use runBackupJobAsync(options) ... or the `db-backup` CLI ..."
```

The CLI already does the right thing for you — every `db-backup backup`
invocation awaits `runBackupJobAsync` internally, whether or not `--s3-bucket`
is set, so `--s3-bucket` at the CLI just works.

```js
const {
  runBackupJobAsync,
  runBackupJob,
  listBackupsWithPlan,
  restoreBackup,
  DEFAULT_RETENTION_POLICY,
} = require('@andrewpopov/db-backup');

// In-process caller (e.g. an admin API route) — always use the async API,
// whether or not S3 is configured this run, so a later switch to --s3-bucket
// never turns into a silent event-loop freeze.
const result = await runBackupJobAsync({
  mode: 'prod',
  outputDir: '/var/backups/myapp',
  s3: { bucket: 'my-bucket', prefix: 'myapp' }, // omit for rclone/local-only, same as runBackupJob
});

console.log(result.created.fileName);

// A script/tool with no S3 remote can still use the synchronous API.
const localResult = runBackupJob({
  mode: 'prod',
  outputDir: '/var/backups/myapp',
  remote: { target: 'offsite:myapp' }, // rclone, or omit + skipRemote for local-only
});

const restored = restoreBackup({
  mode: 'prod',
  outputDir: '/var/backups/myapp',
  backupFile: 'sqlite-backup-20260219-030000Z.db.gz',
});

console.log(restored.target);
```

### Runtime injection for tests and hosted environments

Most apps should not pass `runtime`. It exists for deterministic tests and for
hosts that need to wrap command execution:

```js
runBackupJob({
  databaseUrl: 'postgresql://user:password@db.example.com/myapp',
  outputDir: '/var/backups/myapp',
  runtime: {
    now: () => new Date('2026-07-05T03:00:00.000Z'),
    commandExists: (command) => command === 'pg_dump',
    execFileSync: (command, args, options) => {
      // Run, log, sandbox, or fake command execution here.
    },
  },
});
```

The default runtime uses Node's `child_process.execFileSync`, checks commands via
`command -v`, sleeps between locked-SQLite retries, and reads the current time
from `new Date()`. For the native S3 remote specifically, `runtime.env`
(default `process.env`) is where credentials and `DB_BACKUP_S3_TIMEOUT_MS` are
read from, and `runtime.fetchImpl` is the injectable HTTP layer — tests pass a
mock here so nothing ever touches the network; production leaves it unset and
gets the real, async global `fetch`.

## Restore behavior

- `restore` requires `--file <name|path>` or `--latest`.
- By default, a safety backup is created before restore. Disable with
  `--no-pre-backup`.
- SQLite restore replaces the configured DB file.
- PostgreSQL restore uses `pg_restore --clean --if-exists --single-transaction`.
- PostgreSQL restore targets are redacted in return values so passwords are not
  echoed in logs.
- `restore` takes the same advisory lock (`.db-backup.lock` in `outputDir`) as
  `backup` and `prune`, so a scheduled backup can never run while a restore is
  replacing the database, and vice versa. Skipped when `outputDir` doesn't
  exist — a `--file` outside `outputDir` needs no local lock.

After restore, restart the application before serving traffic.

### SQLite restore is safe by default: it refuses rather than destroys

Since 0.14.0, restoring over a **live** SQLite database — one still open in a
running app — no longer silently eats writes made after the restore. This is
exactly the failure mode that used to hit an app like cairn, whose
`db-backup restore --prod --latest` ran against the live `cairn.db` while the
API was up: the API held an open fd, restore unlinked it out from under the
process, and every write the app made between the restore and its next
restart vanished with no error at all.

Restore now does three things, in order, whenever a live database exists at
the destination:

1. **Verifies integrity first.** The restored backup is checked with
   `PRAGMA integrity_check` on a temp path before it ever touches the live
   file. If `sqlite3` isn't installed, restore now **aborts** instead of
   silently skipping this check — pass `skipVerify` (`--skip-verify`) to
   proceed unverified anyway (unsafe).
2. **Proves writers are quiesced, or refuses.** Pass `stopWriters` /
   `startWriters` (a synchronous function, or a shell-command string — CLI:
   `--stop-writers-cmd <cmd>` / `--start-writers-cmd <cmd>`) so this package
   can quiesce your app itself. Either way, restore attempts to prove
   quiescence with a bounded `BEGIN EXCLUSIVE; COMMIT;` against the live
   database. If that can't be proven, restore **refuses** with a clear error
   — pass `allowOnlineRestore` (`--force-online`) to override at your own
   risk. `startWriters` always runs afterward (even if the restore itself
   fails), so a stopped app is never left down.
3. **Takes a rescue snapshot before touching anything.** A byte-for-byte copy
   of the live database (plus its `-wal`/`-shm`/`-journal` sidecars, if any)
   is written to `<outputDir>/.rescue/<dbname>-<ISO>.db` — always, not just
   when the pre-restore safety backup is enabled. If any later step fails,
   the live database is automatically restored from this copy instead of
   being left missing or half-swapped. `RestoreResult.rescuePath` reports
   where it landed.

```js
const { restoreBackup } = require('@andrewpopov/db-backup');

const result = restoreBackup({
  databaseUrl: 'file:./data/app.db',
  outputDir: './backups/database',
  useLatest: true,
  stopWriters: 'pm2 stop my-app',
  startWriters: 'pm2 start my-app',
});

console.log(result.rescuePath); // e.g. ./backups/database/.rescue/app-2026-07-12T...db
```

`allowOnlineRestore` and `skipVerify` are documented escape hatches, not
defaults — using either means restore can no longer prove it won't destroy
data. `backup` is unaffected by any of this; only `restore` changed.

## Verify locally

```bash
npm ci
npm run verify
```

The local release gate runs type checks, the backup behavior suite, packed
artifact smoke checks, and the runtime dependency audit. It does not replace
the real-service restore drills required for a production deployment.

## What stays app-specific

The package does not decide where backups should live, who can trigger them, or
how a web UI should present them. Those concerns belong in the host application —
an admin controller, a settings layer — as a thin adapter over the programmatic
API, not inside the package.
